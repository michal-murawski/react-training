Hello! My name is Michal Murawski. This is a workshop repo we will be using during our React fundamentals training.


## Pre-workshop requirments

Few steps that I strongly recommend you should accomplish before the workshop. It will allow us to more efficient use our time together.

1. Install required enronment (instructions below)
2. Read and verify your knowledge from [JavaScript to Know for React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) article.
3. Try to go through [React Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs) course. This will allow us to proceed faster with material and focus on more advanced aspects.
4. Install React Developer Tools.
